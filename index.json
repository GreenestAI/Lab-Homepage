To tackle this problem, we propose a novel graph-based monitoring framework that employs advanced graph-based techniques to detect and diagnose sludge bulking events. The proposed framework utilizes historical datasets under normal operating conditions to extract pertinent features and causal relationships between process variables. This enables operators to trigger alarms and diagnose the root cause of the bulking event. Sludge bulking detection is carried out using the dynamic graph embedding (DGE) method, which identifies similarities among process variables in both temporal and neighborhood dependencies.

The prediction of toxicant effects with reasonable accuracy in organisms of water bodies and other environmental compartments lies in the application of a chemical toxicity model with further risk assessment analysis. This review summarizes well-known and recent advances of modeling techniques to evaluate and monitor toxicity in the environment.

One of the major challenges of the fourth industrial revolution era for the electronics industry is how to treat electronics industrial wastewater efficiently. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an electronics industrial wastewater modeling technique that can evaluate the removal efficiency of organic pollutants, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), by digital twinning an electronics industrial organic wastewater treatment facility in a cyber physical system (CPS). In this study, an electronics industrial wastewater activated sludge model (e-ASM) was developed based on the theoretical reaction rates for the removal mechanisms of electronics industrial wastewater considering the growth and decay of micro-organisms. The developed e-ASM can model complex biological removal mechanisms, such as the inhibition of nitrification micro-organisms by non-biodegradable organic pollutants including TMAH, as well as the oxidation, nitrification, and denitrification processes. The proposed e-ASM can be implemented as a Water Digital Twin for real electronics industrial wastewater treatment systems and be utilized for process modeling, effluent quality prediction, process selection, and design efficiency across varying influent characteristics on a CPS.","tags":null,"title":"Water digital twin for high-tech electronics industrial wastewater treatment system (I): e-ASM development and digital simulation implementation","type":"publications"},{"authors":["SungKu Heo","Chanhyeok Jeong","Nahui Lee","Yerim Shim","TaeYong Woo","JeongIn Kim","ChangKyoo Yoo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"a2153a7bc71ed6d9777e7245f7cab6a9","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2022_28_1_heo_clean_technology_water_digital_twin.html","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2022_28_1_heo_clean_technology_water_digital_twin.html","section":"publications","summary":"In this study, an electronics industrial wastewater activated sludge model (e-ASM) to be used as a Water Digital Twin was calibrated based on real high-tech electronics industrial wastewater treatment measurements from lab-scale and pilot-scale reactors, and examined for its treatment performance, effluent quality prediction, and optimal process selection. For specialized modeling of a high-tech electronics industrial wastewater treatment system, the kinetic parameters of the e-ASM were identified by a sensitivity analysis and calibrated by the multiple response surface method (MRS). The calibrated e-ASM showed a high compatibility of more than 90% with the experimental data from the lab-scale and pilot-scale processes. Four electronics industrial wastewater treatment processes-MLE, A2/O, 4-stage MLE-MBR, and Bardenpo-MBR-were implemented with the proposed Water Digital Twin to compare their removal efficiencies according to various electronics industrial wastewater characteristics. Bardenpo-MBR stably removed more than 90% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and showed the highest nitrogen removal efficiency. Furthermore, a high concentration of 1,800 mg L-1 T MAH influent could be 98% removed when the HRT of the Bardenpho-MBR process was more than 3 days.

However, due to various water usage and sources, it is challenging to forecast the fluctuating influent loads. To deal with highly nonlinear and temporal-correlated characteristics of influent loads, in this article, we proposed hybrid influent forecasting model based on multimodal and ensemble-based deep learning (ME-DeepL). The proposed ME-DeepL forecasting model combines strength of multiple deep-learning algorithms in ensemble-learning architecture to handle propagated intrinsic sublayers by empirical mode decomposition of influent loads. Then, the proposed model was assessed to predict the loads on long-term (daily), and short-term (hourly) with multisteps forecast horizons.

Media-integrated human health risk assessment and sensitivity analysis were conducted to predict the human health risk of BTEX and identify the critical variable which has adverse effects on human health.

In the present study, a novel monitoring and sensor placement approach is proposed for rapid and robust burst detection. Accordingly, a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA) and standardized exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) system is proposed for WDN monitoring and management. In addition, the optimal sensor configuration is obtained using PCA, k-means clustering, and a sensitivity analysis considering the diurnal patterns and the noises of pressure and flowrate data in the WDN. The proposed system is applied to a branched WDN, and the results are compared to those obtained with conventional monitoring systems. The results show that the proposed system detected the burst occurrence regardless of noise size with a detection rate of 93%. Compared to conventional systems, the isolation ratio improved by 10%, indicating that the bursts were isolated more accurately. In addition, the corresponding sensor configuration was 40% less expensive than the conventional systems.","tags":null,"title":"An efficient burst detection and isolation monitoring system for water distribution networks using multivariate statistical techniques","type":"publications"},{"authors":["KhangWei Tan","SungKu Heo","MeiLing Foo","Irene MeiLeng Chew","ChangKyoo Yoo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"acf321e95f35323f12a9e094abe2ce93","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2019_650_tan_unknown_journal_an_insight_into.html","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2019_650_tan_unknown_journal_an_insight_into.html","section":"publications","summary":"Nanocellulose, a structural polysaccharide that has caught tremendous interests nowadays due to its renewability, inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability, abundance in resource, and environmental friendly nature. They are promising green nanomaterials derived from cellulosic biomass that can be disintegrated into cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) or cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), relying on their sensitivity to hydrolysis at the axial spacing of disordered domains. Owing to their unique mesoscopic characteristics at nanoscale, nanocellulose has been widely researched and incorporated as a reinforcement material in composite materials. The world has been consuming the natural resources at a much higher speed than the environment could regenerate.

Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models are a promising alternative to in vitro methods to predict the toxicological effects of chemicals on human health. In this study, we assessed a deep-learning based QSAR (DL-QSAR) model to predict the qualitative and the quantitative effects of EDCs on the human endocrine system, and especially sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and estrogen receptor (ER). Statistical analyses of the qualitative responses indicated that the accuracies of all three DL-QSAR methods were above 90%, and greater than the other statistical and machine learning models, indicating excellent classification performance.

Therefore, for a quick response in controlling the time-varying indoor PM10 concentration and to design a well-adapted control system for various outdoor air quality (OAQ), a flexible optimal real-time ventilation control strategy was developed.
