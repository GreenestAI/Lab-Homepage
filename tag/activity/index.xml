We developed a forecasting model framework called M3-PMFormer to forecast particulate matter (PM) 2.5, and 10 spatially and temporally across South Korea. This novel AI framework can figure out spatio-temporal dynamics of PM2.5 and PM10 from the multimodality dataset. Go three idiots !!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Global collaboration meeting, NASA JPL</title><link>https://greenest-ai.kangwon.ac.kr/news/2025-07-151.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://greenest-ai.kangwon.ac.kr/news/2025-07-151.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Prof. SungKu Heo had a productive meeting with researchers from NASA&amp;rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to discuss potential global collaborations in the field of multi-scale modeling and monitoring of climate change adaptation.
