The founding team (Taeyoon, Jeongun, Wonjae) provide the first conference presentation of our lab in KOSAE. We developed a forecasting model framework called M3-PMFormer to forecast particulate matter (PM) 2.5, and 10 spatially and temporally across South Korea. This novel AI framework can figure out spatio-temporal dynamics of PM2.5 and PM10 from the multimodality dataset. Go three idiots !!
