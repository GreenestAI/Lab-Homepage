Prof. SungKu Heo participated in a panel discussion during Session 1: “New Challenges in Water Management Toward Net Zero” at the Chuncheon Global Water Forum 2025, where he shared perspectives based on his work in environmental systems and water and wastewater process modeling and optimization.

In the discussion, Prof. Heo emphasized that achieving net-zero water management requires a structured evaluation of carbon emissions across multiple scopes. He highlighted the importance of assessing direct emissions from water and wastewater treatment processes (Scope 1), energy-related emissions associated with electricity and energy use (Scope 2), and indirect emissions arising from supply chains and related activities (Scope 3). He further noted that recent discussions have expanded to Scope 4, which considers avoided or reduced emissions enabled by improved technologies and systems.

He also introduced data-driven and artificial intelligence–based operational optimization as a practical pathway for reducing emissions, noting that improvements in operational efficiency can significantly reduce energy-related emissions in treatment facilities.

In addition, Prof. Heo discussed the role of nature-based solutions (Nbs), emphasizing that clear and explicit design is required to determine which NBS technologies should be selected and implemented, as their effectiveness depends on defined objectives, site-specific conditions, and robust evaluation frameworks.

The session facilitated in-depth discussions among experts from academia, industry, and policy sectors, providing a meaningful platform for exploring strategies toward carbon-neutral and sustainable water management.
