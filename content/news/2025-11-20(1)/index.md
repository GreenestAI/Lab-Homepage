We participated in the conference of the Korean Society of Environmental Engineers (KSEE) held on November 20 at Shinhwa World, Jeju Island.
Prof. SungKu Heo and undergraduate student Seonju Kim attended the conference to share and discuss recent research activities related to data-driven and AI-based approaches for environmental engineering systems. Go Greenest!
