The founding team delivered the first presentation of our lab in KOSAE, and we are thrilled to share that we received the [encouragement prize](https://drive.google.com/file/d/122voRNTE8TtOIwGI49BZHYPaxPShTLlA/view?usp=drive_link) for our work. Our team developed an innovative forecasting model called M3-PMFormer, which predicts particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) across South Korea in both spatial and temporal domains. This AI system effectively captures the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of PM concentrations using a multimodal dataset. Go three idiots!!
