The founding team delivered the first presentation of our lab in KOSAE, and we are thrilled to share that we received the [encouragement prize](./미세먼지공모전%20장려상.pdf) for our work. Our team developed an innovative forecasting model called M3-PMFormer, which predicts particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀) across South Korea in both spatial and temporal domains. This AI system effectively captures the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of PM concentrations using a multimodal dataset. Go three idiots!!
