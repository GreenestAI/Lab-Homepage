Prof. SungKu Heo (Corresponding author) published a paper titled "Predictive monitoring of wastewater treatment performance using machine learning: A case study on a full-scale membrane bioreactor" in the Journal of Water Process Engineering (JCR 6.5%, IF: 6.7). This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to enhance the monitoring and performance prediction of wastewater treatment processes, specifically focusing on a full-scale membrane bioreactor system. The research highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches to improve operational efficiency, optimize treatment outcomes, and support sustainable water management practices. The findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the integration of advanced technologies in environmental engineering and water resource management. The paper is accessible via the following DOI link: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2025.107718](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2025.107718).
