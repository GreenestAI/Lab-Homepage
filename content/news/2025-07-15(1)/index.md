Prof. SungKu Heo had a productive meeting with researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to discuss potential global collaborations in the field of multi-scale modeling and monitoring of climate change adaptation. This collaboration aims to leverage advanced remote sensing technologies and data analytics to better understand and address the impacts of climate change on various ecosystems and communities. By combining expertise from both institutions, the partnership seeks to develop innovative solutions that can enhance climate resilience, improve resource management, and support sustainable development initiatives worldwide. The meeting marked the beginning of an exciting journey towards harnessing the power of multi-scale modeling to drive advancements in climate science and promote effective adaptation strategies. We look forward to the fruitful outcomes of this collaboration and the positive impact it will have on global efforts to combat climate change.
