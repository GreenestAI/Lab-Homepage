**About me**

I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) researcher at [LIPhy](https://liphy.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/)
in Grenoble, France. I use molecular simulations to study fluids at interfaces
and soft matter systems.

**Open source and outreach activities**

I share all the codes developed as part of my research as open source, see my
[Github](https://github.com/simongravelle/) repository. See also
[MAICoS](https://maicos-devel.gitlab.io/maicos/index.html), a Python toolkit for
analyzing confined molecular simulations, [LAMMPS tutorials](https://github.com/lammpstutorials),
[MDCourse](https://github.com/mdcourse/mdcourse.github.io), [GROMACS tutorials](https://gromacstutorials.github.io),
my [gallery of animations](https://www.youtube.com/@SimonGravelle) and [molecular art](https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/).
