from the terminal, execute the python file to generate the data file (or download it directly)
> python GenerateSystem.py
then, run the lammps script (the command depends on your lammps installation)
> lammps -in in
when the simulation is done, you can plot atom position from the dump file, using VMD for example 
> vmd dump.water.lammpstrj
